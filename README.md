Open Source Startup Ideas. Let's make the world a better place!
加速想法落地，助力改变世界。

## Intention 初衷
I have always been a guy who is full of innovative ideas. Before I started my current full-time job at Citic Securities, I was a serial-practitioner in entrepreneurship in college. Most failed, but I did manage to succeed twice. After I reverse-engineered my failure, I realized that the ability to write code and have an all-round team are two vital determinants to be a successful tech entrepreneur. So I decided to self-teach myself to be a programmer while finding partners with complementary skills.

One day, while I was refactoring a for-loop by list comprehension in Python, I suddenly realized it is almost impossible for me to execute all the ideas. Maybe I should just make them open-sourced, so that people with same vision but better skillsets could execute my ideas and increase the overall utility of our world. Then I turned my [Ideas Library Trello board](https://trello.com/b/BIweoXtT/ideas-library) public visible and started a column called [Startup Ideas](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/startupideas) on Zhihu, mainly for Chinese entrepreneurs. From then on, I could just be amazed by how eager people want to start their business but needed ideas support.

Now I decide to help non-Chinese entrepreneurs to enter the biggest consumer market in the world, with ideas from this book. Starting a business is by no mean a easy job, not to mention in a country where culture is totally different (sometimes opposite) from the rest of the world. I will try my best to provide a suggested procedure and a prototype for every idea, especially for the initial stage, so that you will have a better confidence of execution. I regard these as the Unique Selling Point of this book. The book is not only a list of ideas, but a wordbook towards actually landing ideas into startups. Because of my limited awareness, I cannot guarantee that all ideas are not being executed yet, so please make sure you do your own research as well.

All ideas are 100% original, they are free to use. The repository will be updated as more ideas flowing to my mind. If you would like to contact with me about ideas, please feel free to submit an issue.

Let us make the world a better place with our initiatives!
