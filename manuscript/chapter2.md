# Chapter 2 AI and Machine Learning
## 1. Personal Assistant in China
Imagine you have a personal assistant like the wealthy who handles your routine of everyday life and save your time. Now with the help of AI, this might not be just a dream. There are already several democratization providers in the US. One of them is **Fin**.

> **More powerful than a digital assistant**
>> Fin can call, email, text, schedule, research, book, and purchase for you. Talk to Fin using voice transcription that actually works. Add Fin to email chains. Fin understands context, learns your preferences, and handles nuanced requests.

> **More flexible than a traditional assistant**
>> Fin is available 24 x 7 x 365. We hire and manage a highly skilled and educated team, so you don't have to. You pay only for what you use, down to the minute.

> **Always learning and improving**
>> We review every request, learn from mistakes, and only charge for quality. Fin connects to your services and learns to better serve you over time. Fin applies what it learns from all the people it interacts with to make your experience better.

Another example is [**X.ai**](https://x.ai/how-it-works/), their AI software is set to ease the pain of scheduling for business.

The hard fact is that Fin has been sueing by unhappy customers from day 1, as Fin cannot provide the quality of service it has promised. Fin has been forced to transit into a B2B business ealier this year.

Standing at the time of 2019, as China is no longer a country full of cheap labor and the division of labor reaching the level of a developed economy, we could expect a decent growth in the demand for AI-powered personal assistantancy. But the major thread of this business is actually the hardness of data acuisition from both the supply and demand sides. As for demand side, Chinese major messaging tool WeChat is famoust for closeness and email is not preferred by most Chinese without oversee experience, which makes even sending publich notifications to clients hard without the permission of WeChat. The same difficuly for supply side comes from O2O (Online-to-offline) big players, like Meituan, Ele.me (by Alibaba). As most of the personal assistantancy demand is already met by their service, like food delivery, movie booking and city touring, within several taps on a customer's smartphone. To be even worse, those O2O companies do not publish their open APIs for business listings like what Yelp APIs did, which means your AI is not feeded with enough data unless a mighty-illegal scraping script is running.

And you should never expect too much for AI, you have to be responsible for the quality of service provided. If needed, a dedicated well-trained team should be set up to provide on-demand service from clients. But in that case, a lower profit margin should be well-expected.

It seems that a "Jarvis" for every Chinese might still remains the Goblet of Fire for AI startups for sometime, until the next Steve Jobs maybe?

### Successful Determinants
1. Your AI program is data-abundant.
2. Be reponsible for the quality and consistency of your service.
3. Maintain the business margin with high operating cost.

### Suggested Procedure
I am not confident about the success of this business, so as I cannot guaranteed the procedure below to be suggested.
1. Do product research on Fin and X.ai, make a list of categories of service they provide.
2. Do research on data acquisiton from [Dianping Open platform](https://open.dianping.com/document/v2?docId=6000146&rootDocId=1000) and notification setting from [WeChat official Accounts Platform](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/), do cross-check on what service is achievable in China from the list you make in step 1.
3. Do things that don't scale! Start as a WeChat Official Account to provide assistantancy service and gain experience on the standardization and automation of your service. You do not want to waste time building original mobile apps as they are not as agile to test your hypothesis about a profitable business in this field.
4. As you make your customers happy, you could start your growth hacking journey, city by city. Always make sure your supply capacity is redundant to your demand so as to lower your risk of inconsistent customer satisfaction rate.
5. A promising future could be acquired by Meituan or BAT. There is a low probability for this business to be a public-listed company due to data acquisiton.

## 2. Human Intelligence on Demand
Like [Scale API](https://scale.ai/), the API for training data. Scale's API provides access to **human-powered** data for hundreds of use cases, including computer vision like sensor fusion, video, semantic segmentation, cuboids, polygons, 2D boxes and lines & splines, other products including OCR transription, categorization and comparison.

>**How It Works**
>>After sending us your data via API call, our platform through a combination of human work and review, smart tools, statistical confidence checks and machine learning checks returns scalable, accurate ground truth data.

## 3. AI Web Backend
Use AI to build a web app backend and auto-figure out user's requests and return an response accordingly. It matches the trend of serverless.

## 4. Wechat Bot for Heterosexuals
Altough female and male share the same language system, but we can still be confident that they speak different languages. As females are generally more emotional while males are more logical, the communication barrier does exist between them, especially for the youth having their very first love experience. It is not uncommon that we heard a couple's break=up traced back to a tiny oral conflict. Girls are always complaining the sturburness of guys and guys are tired of guessing games. Why only Pick-up Artist could be the mastery in this field? AI could exactly be your helper.

By traing NLP with a sufficient amount of conversation data, the algorithm could judge the emotion whether to be positive or negative better than human and crack the hidden truely intention begind the sentences, especially from women.

To be not over-exagerated, anyone who builds this chatbot should win the Nobel Prize for Economics, as to solve the communication barrier betwwen one half of population to the other.

Heal the world, make it a better place...
