All the ideas below are related with computer programming and programmer.

## 1. DevStickers in China
[DevStickers](https://devstickers.com/) is a marketplace that sells stickers and t-shirts for Web Developer's favorite tools and technologies. According to my current awareness, there is currently no such marketplace in China.

As more 90s and 00s becoming programmers, products and accessories that demonstrate personality will be in good sale.

### Suggested Procedure
1. Do the market research on DevStickers's most popular products. Programming languages are universal, it is very likely the popularity is similar in China. Also, the customer segmentation could be quite similar. So at least after the research, you will have a short-list of your initial products and user groups. I bet React and Vue will top the list.
2. Pick print-on-demand drop-shipping supplier. Not like in the US market where you can find a bundle of mature suppliers like Gooten and Printful, there is few trustworthy supplier in China. I would only recommend [EASYPNP](http://easypnp.com/) as they are the best in on-demand printing in China. Also, seriously consider if you would like to stock some inventories using oversea suppliers for initial stages to get rid of the communication barrier with domestic supplier.
3. Create your brand. Choose your brand name wisely, better with a Chinese meaning.
4. Start your online store on Alibaba Taobao following [this procedure](https://world.taobao.com/helper/knowledge.htm?kid=6563218). Taobao is the largest Chinese C2C e-commerce platform with 448 million monthly-active users (MAU). **Building a Shopify-liked e-commerce website from scratch is not the best choice in China, as customers are more used to shopping on platforms.**
4. Recruit your first several users and give them free sample for feedback. You can try:
  1. Give free sample to your connections in China
  2. Cold call/email Chinese programmers using LinkedIn
5. Promote your product on largest Chinese programmer communities with advertisement and event-sponsorship. You might need a Chinese-speaking partner like:
  1. [OSChina](https://www.oschina.net/)
  2. [SegmentFault](https://segmentfault.com/)
  3. [CSDN](https://www.csdn.net/)
  4. [Juejin](https://juejin.im/)
6. Find business consumers and be their supplier. For decoration purpose, they will have enough paying willingness. Including:
  1. Co-working Spaces
  2. Tech-driven Startups
